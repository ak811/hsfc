# Hand Segmentation and Finger Counting with Convex Hull

<br>

## Overview
The objective of this project is to segment and count the fingers present in an image of a hand with high accuracy. To achieve this, image processing techniques such as contour detection and Gaussian blur, along with Euclidean distance, will be employed to separate the hand from the background. The Convex Hull method will then be utilized to pinpoint the fingers within the segmented hand image. This method involves finding the smallest convex shape that encompasses a set of points and will be used by identifying the points on the hand that form the convex shape.
